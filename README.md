# DEPRECATED

This project is no longer maintained. Its functionality is being incorporated into [yapp-scroll-view](https://github.com/yappbox/yapp-scroll-view).

# Ember-virtual-scrollkit

This addon is designed to work with [Ember Collection](https://github.com/emberjs/ember-collection). Alone, Ember Collection is insufficient for iOS UIWebview use because iOS does not send scroll events until momentum scrolling has finished.

This project gives you UIWebView-capable virtual scrolling on top of Ember-Collection. It achieves this via Zynga Scroller.

## Installation

```
ember install ember-virtual-scrollkit
```
